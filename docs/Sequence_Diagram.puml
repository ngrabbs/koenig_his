actor Operator as OP
participant "C2 Server" as C2
participant "EPC / Core" as EPC
participant "eNodeB" as ENB
participant "Flight Controller\n(ESP32 + SIM7600)" as FC
participant "Pi‑Cam 760" as P760
participant "Pi‑Cam 770" as P770
participant "Pi‑Cam 780" as P780

== Command Injection ==
OP -> C2 : POST /add_command\n{ id:42, action:"sleep", value:10 }
C2 -> C2 : Queue command 42

== Command Poll ==
FC -> C2 : GET /commands
C2 --> FC : JSON [{id:42,action:sleep, ...}]
FC -> C2 : POST /acknowledge {acknowledged:[42]}
C2 --> C2 : Remove 42 from queue
FC -> FC : Process sleep(10s)
... (wake up) ...

== Capture Trigger Cycle ==
FC -> FC : GPIO HIGH 250 ms (Capture)
FC -> P760 ++ : trigger
FC -> P770 ++ : trigger
FC -> P780 ++ : trigger

== Metadata & Histogram Upload ==
P760 -> FC : meta+hist JSON \n(type:capture,filter_id:760,...)
P770 -> FC : meta+hist JSON
P780 -> FC : meta+hist JSON
FC -> C2  : POST /pi_meta (three times)

== Conditional JPEG Transfer (example 770 only) ==
FC -> P770 : "SEND_IMG"
P770 -> FC : [chunked JPEG stream]
FC -> C2  : POST /upload_image (binary)

== Periodic Telemetry ==
loop every telemetryInterval
    FC -> C2 : POST /telemetry { batt,rssi,lat,lon }
end

== LTE Attach at Boot ==
FC -> ENB : RRC Attach Req
ENB -> EPC : S1 Attach
EPC --> ENB : Attach Accept
ENB --> FC  : Attach Accept
